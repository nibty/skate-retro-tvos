# skate-retro-tvos
A retro Skateboard tvOS and iOS game built with SpritKit and Swift

A very simple little retro skateboarding game. This is my first attempt at an iOS game using the SpriteKit engine. This game was built for the appleTV and has since been ported to all iOS products. The games is based on Mark Priceâ€™s Apple TV Udemy tutorial (https://www.udemy.com/apple-tv). All graphics were also provided by him.

The app can be side loaded onto an Apple TV, iPhone, or iPad using Xcode.

## Game Instructions
Tap to jump over obstacles and swipe to do tricks in the air. Earn points for every obstacle passed.
